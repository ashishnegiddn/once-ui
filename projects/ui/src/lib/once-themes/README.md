## Using a pre-built theme

The once-ui comes with prepackaged several themes in css files. These themes can be added in your style.css file( common css file). So you have to include single css file in your whole application.

You can include a theme file directly into your application from `@once/ui/prebuilt-themes`

Available prebuilt themes

- `oncehub.css`
- `scheduleonce.css`
- `inviteonce.css`
- `chatonce.css`

You have to add single one line in style.css file

```css
@import '~@once/ui/prebuilt-themes/oncehub.css';
```
